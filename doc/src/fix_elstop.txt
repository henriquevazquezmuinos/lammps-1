fix elstop command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID group-ID elstop Ecut file keyword value ... :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "fix"_fix.html command :ulb,l
elstop = style name of this fix command :l
Ecut = minimum kinetic energy for electronic stopping (energy units) :l
file = name of the file containing the electronic stopping power table :l
zero or more keyword/value pairs may be appended to args :l
keyword = {region} :l
  {region} value = region-ID
    region-ID = ID of region atoms must be in to have stopping power applied :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

fix el all elstop 10.0 elstop-table.txt
fix el mygroup elstop 1.0 elstop-table.txt region bulk :pre

[Description:]

TODO: general description here; Mention at least: what is electronic
stopping, what does the formula look like, linear interpolation

The electronic stopping described here is not applied to atoms whose
kinetic energy is smaller than {Ecut}, or smaller than the lowest energy
value given in the table in {file}. Also, electronic stopping is not
applied to atoms which have 5 or fewer neighbors.

If the {region} keyword is used, the atom must also be in the
specified geometric "region"_region.html in order to have electronic
stopping applied to it.

The applicable electronic stopping powers and energy ranges are read
from the file {file}. See below for a description of the file format.

:line

The energy ranges and stopping powers are read from the file {file}.
Lines starting with {#} and empty lines are ignored. Otherwise each
line must contain exactly N+1 numbers, where N is the number of atom
types in the simulation.

The first column is the energy for which the stopping powers on that
line apply. The other columns are the stopping powers for each atom
type, in ascending order, in force units.

For example:

# This is a comment
 10    0    0
250   60   80
750  100  150 :pre

The table file below shows two energy ranges: the first from 10 to 250
energy units, and the second from 250 to 750 energy units. There must
be exactly two atom types in the simulation. Atoms of type 1 with
kinetic energies in the first range experience electronic stopping
below 60 force units. Atoms of type 2 with kinetic energies in the
second range experience electronic stopping between 80 and 150 force
units.

[Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info:]

No information about this fix is written to "binary restart
files"_restart.html.

The "fix_modify"_fix_modify.html options are not supported.

This fix computes a global scalar, which can be accessed by various
"output commands"_Howto_output.html. The scalar is the total energy
loss from electronic stopping applied by this fix since the start of
the latest run. It is considered "intensive".

The {start/stop} keywords of the "run"_run.html command have no effect
on this fix.

[Restrictions:]

This pair style is part of the USER-MISC package. It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package. See the "Build package"_Build_package.html
doc page for more info.

[Default:]

The default is no limitation by region.
