fix elstop command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID group-ID elstop Ecut file keyword value ... :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "fix"_fix.html command :ulb,l
elstop = style name of this fix command :l
Ecut = minimum kinetic energy for electronic stopping (energy units) :l
file = name of the file containing the electronic stopping power table :l
zero or more keyword/value pairs may be appended to args :l
keyword = {region} :l
  {region} value = region-ID
    region-ID = ID of region atoms must be in to have stopping power applied :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

fix el all elstop 10.0 elstop-table.txt
fix el mygroup elstop 1.0 elstop-table.txt region bulk :pre

[Description:]

This fix allows to simulate the slow down of fast ions inside the
material due to "electronic stopping power"_#elstopping (energy lost 
via electronic collisions per unit of distance). This fix should be 
used when simulating irradiation damage or ion implantation, where 
the ions can lose noticeable amounts of energy in electron scatterings. 
If the electronic stopping power is not considered, the simulated 
range of the ions can be severely overestimated ("Nordlund98"_#Nordlund98,
 "Nordlund95"_#Nordlund95).


The electronic stopping is implemented by applying a friction force 
to the ion as:

:c,image(Eqs/fix_elstop.jpg)

where{ F<sub>0</sub>} is the original force applied to the ion, {v&#x20d7} is its 
velocity and {S<sub>e</sub>} is the stopping power of the ion.



NOTE: In addition to electronic stopping, atomic cascades and irradiation 
simulations require the use of adaptive timestep (see 
"fix dt/reset"_fix_dt_reset.html) and repulsive ZBL potential (see 
"ZBL"_pair_zbl.html potential). Without these settings the interaction between the 
ion and the target atoms will be faulty. It is also common to use in 
such simulations a thermostat ("fix_nvt"_fix_nvt.html) in the borders of the 
simulation cell. 


At low ion velocities the electronic stopping is negligible. The parameter 
The electronic friction is not applied to atoms whose
kinetic energy is smaller than {Ecut}, or smaller than the lowest energy
value given in the table in {file}. Also, electronic stopping is not
applied to atoms which have 5 or fewer neighbors.

NOTE: The ion is applied the friction force as soon as it enters the 
neighbour list of the atoms. In surface simulations this approach 
can lead to unphysical behaviour if the interaction cutoff is large. 
In these situations it is recommended to use the region keyword instead.

If the {region} keyword is used, the atom must also be in the
specified geometric "region"_region.html in order to have electronic
stopping applied to it.

The applicable electronic stopping powers and energy ranges are read
from the file {file}. See below for a description of the file format.

:line

The energy ranges and stopping powers are read from the file {file}.
Lines starting with {#} and empty lines are ignored. Otherwise each
line must contain exactly N+1 numbers, where N is the number of atom
types in the simulation.

The first column is the energy for which the stopping powers on that
line apply. The other columns are the stopping powers for each atom
type, in ascending order, in force units.

For example:

# This is a comment
 10    0    0
250   60   80
750  100  150 :pre

The table file below shows two energy ranges: the first from 10 to 250
energy units, and the second from 250 to 750 energy units. There must
be exactly two atom types in the simulation. Atoms of type 1 with
kinetic energies in the first range experience electronic stopping
below 60 force units. Atoms of type 2 with kinetic energies in the
second range experience electronic stopping between 80 and 150 force
units.



NOTE: Swift Heavy Ions (energy per nucleon of 100 keV/amu or higher)
deposit most of the energy via electronic stopping. This implementation
is not suitable for those types of ions. For that purpose one can
use instead the two-temperature model implementation 
("fix_ttm"_fix_ttm.html), which takes into account the transfer of 
energy from the hot electrons in the material to the target atoms.



The stopping power depends on the energy of the ion and the target 
material. The electronic stopping table can be obtained from 
scientific publications, experimental databases or by using 
"SRIM"_#SRIM software. Other programs such as "CasP"_#CasP or 
"PASS"_#PASS can calculate the energy deposited as a function 
of the impact parameter of the ion; these results can be used 
to derive the stopping power.

[Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info:]

No information about this fix is written to "binary restart
files"_restart.html.

The "fix_modify"_fix_modify.html options are not supported.

This fix computes a global scalar, which can be accessed by various
"output commands"_Howto_output.html. The scalar is the total energy
loss from electronic stopping applied by this fix since the start of
the latest run. It is considered "intensive".

The {start/stop} keywords of the "run"_run.html command have no effect
on this fix.

[Restrictions:]

This pair style is part of the USER-MISC package. It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package. See the "Build package"_Build_package.html
doc page for more info.

[Default:]

The default is no limitation by region.
